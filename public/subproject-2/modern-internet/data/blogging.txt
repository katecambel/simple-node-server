The word blog came from the words "web" and "log". It gives people the chance to plug in their thoughts, ideas, experiences, among many other things. A theme enables bloggers to control how their blog looks and to personalize it to find a theme that suits their type personality. Most blogs are made of 4 main sections: header, sidebar, body, footer: header - title or logo & main navigation menu; sidebar - widgets, things you want to highlight; body - main content area, primary reason readers go to blogs; footer - content that usually does not change but has easy access for readers. Difference between the terms Page and Post: Page - static, displaying standard content (about me, contact); Post - thoughts, shown on main page, in an order that shows the most recent one first; newest post is at the top of the blog. Posts are like an online version of a journal made for other people to see. There is a comment section usually at the bottom that includes the community element in blogs. Blogs are a creative way of expression.
