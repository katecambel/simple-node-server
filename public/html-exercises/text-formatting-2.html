        <p> Hi! My name is Katherine Anne T. Cambel, but you could simply call me <em>Kate</em>. I was born in September 10, 1995. I am 19 years old, almost 20 years old in just a few months. I was born in Paranaque City, Metro Manila. I lived in Manila for about 11 years, then we moved to Singapore and lived there for 4 years. Then we moved to Thailand and lived there for about a year. Then we moved back here to the  Philippines. I've been living back here since. I love to dance, read, eat and sleep. I have watched around <em>20</em> television shows. I also love watching <strong>Formula 1</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Fun fact about me is that in the course of 4 years in high school, I studied in <em>3 schools</em> because my mom's job kept moving us to places: <br>Freshman & Sophomore Years: Overseas Family School, Singapore; <br>Junior Year: International School Bangkok, Thailand; <br>Senior Year: International School Manila, Philippines<br>Some would question why I didn't study abroad for university, but even if I was accepted to universities in Canada, I chose to study locally. Therefore I am currently studying in <strong>University of the Philippines Los Banos</strong>, and taking up <em>BA Communication Arts</em>, majoring in <em>Speech Communication</em>. It might seem cliche and all, but even if I have read tons of books, my favorite book, or series per se, is still <cite>Harry Potter</cite> by J.K. Rowling. This is because it goes back to my childhood and it brought me to a whole different world in my imagination. It was my escape. In school, I have always remembered one of my favorite teachers telling me that <q>making decisions doesn't have to be so hard unless you have set your priorities</q>. Over time I found out he was right, and ever since, I have been keeping my priorities in check.</p>
