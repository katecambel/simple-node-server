        <em>3 Favorite Movies at the Moment</em>
        <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/"> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone </a></p>
        The book this movie was based on holds a special place in my heart and was the beginning of my journey with my love for literature. This is one of those rare times that I could say that the book was as good as the movie. Well, they were good in their own ways. The making of the movie was really creative especially the way they portrayed the animation of the wizardry and witchcraft happening around. Aside from that, Harry, being the main character and how little he was back then, had already posed as a promising actor that greatly affected the viewers especially me.
        <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2848292/"> Pitch Perfect 2</a></p>
        Another challenge is laid upon the Barden Bellas as they embark on a new journey regaining the repect of their whole nation. The storyline fell short, but their singing voices and their puns are what kept me watching that movie over and over again. Furthermore, I just couldn't get enough of the Jessie and Becca tandem. 
        <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120762/"> Mulan</a></p>
        People say I look a lot like Mulan from the Disney movie. Maybe it's just because of my Chinese roots coming out and my black hairâ€¦Nevertheless, the movie became one of my childhood favourite movies because she always has that courageous spirit that I have always looked up to. Speaking up and saying how she really felt took up a lot of courage especially in the times when she knows she is right. Long story short, she's my <em>"role model"</em>.

        <em>Some 3 Songs off my PLaylist</em>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2Lz0SxFYek"> Lollipop Cover by Treblemakers</a></p>
        'Cause Skylar Astin. Nuff said. 
    	...Although if I have to write a bit more about it, there is a bunch of guys who go on falsetto while singing the lyrics "suck it!" Who in the <em>straight</em> female population wouldn't enjoy that? Just sayin'. 
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09R8_2nJtjg"> Sugar by Maroon 5</a></p>
        Okay, I really have a knack for men who can sing in falsetto. Case in point, Adam Levine. Other than that, I've been an avid fan of Maroon 5 since the release of their first album, <em>Songs about Jane</em>, came out. It's nice to see them back with this nostalgic song (<em>ironic, isn't it?</em>). I also enjoyed watching the music video. Whether it was real or fake, I always have a weakness for weddings. And now I'm wishing for Maroon 5 to surprise me on my wedding...
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-M1AtrxztU"> Rather Be ft. Jess Glynne by Clean Bandit</a></p>
        This song has a cool vibe to it. Hearing it would always make me want to move my feet to the beat. At the time same time, when <strong>The Crew</strong>, <em>an elite Philippine dance crew</em>, danced to this song during UPLB SJDC's Skirmish Vol. 2 event, it was refreshing that also made us fall in love with the art of dance and music.
