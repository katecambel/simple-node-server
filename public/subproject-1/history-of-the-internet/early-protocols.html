        <p>The foundations of modern Internet are through a scientific, military, and commercial approach. The Internet is a connection of networks</p>

        <p>In <strong>1961</strong>, scientist and engineer Leonard Climrock, also a professor in the computer science department in UCLA, published a paper on packets - smaller fixed length pieces of information that could be sent at different paths and different times, allowing larger pieces of information to be sent efficiently and safely.</p>
        
        <p>In <strong>1962, J.C.R. Licklider</strong>, also a computer scientist and engineer, created a network of computers that can talk to one another. He was the first to develop the idea that the computer can be used as a communication device. </p>
        
        <p>In <strong>1966</strong>, small computers were put in front of the main frame, through the IMP or the Interface Message Processor. The small computers took control of activities. The main frame is in charge of initialization of programs and data files. The IMP served as the interface for the mainframe. The IMP subnet is interconnected in a network. </p>
        	
        	<p>The first connections made through the IMP were made by a Network Working Group developed by the NCP or Network Control Protocol. TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol, whose main feature is verification of file transfer, replaced it and in order to avoid congestion of files, it was cut into smaller packets. This is then called Packet switching. </p>
        
        	<p>In 1962, using <em>RAND</em>, the American aircraft discovered long ranged missiles in Cuba that could attack the US and lit fear of an atomic conflict. Information systems had centralized network architecture and to avoid breakdown, a decentralized network developed that uses direct waves, which had short range. But for improvement, a distributed network was developed thus long distances could be covered with a minimum of interference. </p>
        
        	<p>In France, the <em>CYCLADES</em>, which consisted of smaller budget and fewer nodes, focused on communication with other networks, through this the term "inter-net" was born. This went further than ARPANET and NPLs. </p>
        
        	<p>In the communication between sender and receiver, computers were not to intervene anymore but only to serve as a transfer node. The CYCLADES Protocol went through all machines using a physical layer that was implemented into the hardware, which provided a direct connection with the receiver and an end-to-end structure. </p>
        
        	<p>Before, there were still no fibre wires, thus they had to use the Ethernet. They are telephone wires that go through batch processing. Phone companies even developed the X.25 protocol wherein communication through servers is charged on a monthly basis. They connect through gateways. However they are coppered wires hence they are expensive and unstable.</p>
        
        	<p>The International Organization for Standardization or ISO designed the Open System Interconnection or OPI as an attempt to standardized the network from its ends and the channels division to separate layers. </p>
        
        	<p>In <strong>1969,</strong> Bolt, Beranek and Newman Inc. developed the distributed IMP in UCLA, connecting it to the host computer.</p>
        
        	<p><strong>Vinton Cerf</strong> invented a way to introduce the globe to each other in a virtual way through the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) then followed by Internet Protocol (IP). In the <strong>1980s</strong>, Cerf's protocol was able to send data back and forth. </p>
